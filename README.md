# STATS415-FINAL-PROJECT replication instruction

Under this branch, all codes about the open-ended questions could be found. 

If you want to replicate the process of raw data processing, all the raw data we used are placed in the fold named raw data. For example, the .XPT file named ’DEMO1112.XPT’ means the demographic data collected during 2011-12 period. Or you can directly access to the processed data files in the fold named ’procssed data’ to have a taste of what variables we used, and also detailed information about the dataset we work on. The data-processing code can be found in Data-Cleaning.Rmd.

If you want to replicate all the plots we creates and the model results, please refer to the two Rmd.file saved in the fold named ’code’. For the regression section, run through Regression.Rmd. For the classification section, run through Stats415Project-Classification.Rmd.

We also attach the knitted PDF version of these two .Rmd files at the very end of the project report.
